# Homebridge-AC-Remote

This is a simple plugin for use with Particle devices to transmit AC codes to a dumb AC unit.

## How to Use

* Flash your Particle Device
* Wire up an IR LED
* put in an enclosure (optional)
* place in range of your target AC unit
* install and configure the plugin into Homebridge

## Hardware
Plans will be posted later in this repo.

This implementation is based on the Particle line of devices using the Particle cloud to send/receive telemetry and commands.

## Credits
Thanks to @krvarma for the initial implementation of homebridge-particle.  Much of the code here was reused.

I decided to start a new repo dedicated to AC Controllers rather than fork the above repo, is this is less general use than his intended homebridge-particle plugin.
